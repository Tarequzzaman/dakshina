# dakshina
The Dakshina dataset is a collection of text in both Latin and native scripts for 12 South Asian languages. For each language, the dataset includes a large collection of native script Wikipedia text, a romanization lexicon of words in the native script with attested romanizations, and some full sentence parallel data in both a native script of the language and the basic Latin alphabet. The datset will be available here shortly.
